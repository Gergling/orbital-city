    For a race so alien, they seem very similar to humans. They require gravity
    to exist, so they live in planets and small stars. Star Delta Fields are 
    apparently toxic, so they needed special technology to get to them and farm 
    them.

    What makes them alien is the fascinating way they see space and time. According
    to them, our supercluster is relatively close, while we can only guess at its 
    location on the other side of the universe. Apparently the complex shape of the 
    universe makes it possible to skip certain distances. Perceiving space-time 
    differently, they were able to discern shortcuts to other superclusters. Their 
    inter-planetary technology is understandably advanced.

    Their society includes laws prohibiting the production of such 'addictive' food 
    recipes, but with the definition of addiction so arguable, accountability is 
    dependent on the power of their police force. I am reminded again of our own 
    society.
