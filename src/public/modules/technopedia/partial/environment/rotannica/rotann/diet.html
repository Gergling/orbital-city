    {{race}} sustains themselves on a diet of what they call Delta Fields. Among 
    other things, these consist of changes in gravitational, electrical and magnetic
    fields, which serve as fuel.
</p>

<p>
    A good diet consists of a balance and quantity of these fields, which can vary
    slightly between each {{race}} entity. A bad diet usually leads to various 
    'diseases', which can be contagious amongst the {{race}}, and ultimately result
    in fatal and simultaneous crushing and pulling apart.
</p>

<p>
    {{race}} has managed to create recipes for different combinations of field changes
    frequencies, which they could be considered to 'taste' or 'smell'. Insofar as they
    can be considered to have a psychology or physiology these recipes can result in
    addiction, which they are careful to avoid.
