    Apparently the Delarion are unique in that they have been manufactured as opposed to born. It is evident
    that we do not have the experience of existence to understand the difference. Further research will be 
    required.

    As appears to be common to the other species, they require high temperatures to function, although they 
    appear to be resistant to low temperatures and pressures, which is probably where this manufacturing 
    benefits them over the other species and us, who cannot function over wide temperature ranges.

    They often refer to the youth of other species, having apparently existed for much longer than any of us.
    We ask them how, but we still lack the fundamental comprehension required to understand the answers.
