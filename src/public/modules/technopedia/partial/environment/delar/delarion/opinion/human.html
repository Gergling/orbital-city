    The {{race}} claim to have been 'manufactured', which might be a euphemism.
    They also claim to be 30 billion years old, if the translations and calculations 
    are correct. This is probably the reason they are so condescending. Sometimes 
    they simply respond to a question or statement with 'you are young'. We had 
    predicted intelligent robots to be efficient, conquering war machines which 
    spread across worlds and simply consumed resources, but we didn't expect them to 
    be arrogant about it.

    According to translations, their home planet had a robot uprising, and these 
    guys are the result. This would explain their arrogance, since they are the 
    conquerers of their world, and being the soulless psychopaths that they are, 
    would probably take the entitled position of conquerer over any of our species 
    as well.

    Personally, I don't think they are proper artificial intelligence. I think 
    they are scouts designed and controlled by a race too frightened to leave their 
    homeworld. They are too human to be machines.
