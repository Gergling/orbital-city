    A 'race' of machines. It's a fascinating concept, which we too will one day explore. We already enhance
    ourselves with machinery, so why not replace the whole form?

    They have a centralised reproduction system. Rather than every entity being capable of of producing more
    entities, they have a few specific entities designed for this task. We could call these 'queens'. They
    are tasked with manufacturing the new units from the schematics given to them. As I understand it, the 
    new production from new schematics is petitioned, to maximise the optimum evolutionary speed.

    Their 'recycling' of redundant units could be considered cold and disturbing, but the redundant units 
    consent to this. Sometimes only the software or hardware is redundant, in which case only one needs to 
    be recycled. The overally brith/death system appears to be conciously optimised to evolve them.

    Due to their great interest in studying us, they have made a few creepy androids. We complimented them
    for their efforts and politely asked them to stop and make more obviously mechanical versions instead.
    In an interesting parallel, the other races find this near-similarity to be disturbing as well.
