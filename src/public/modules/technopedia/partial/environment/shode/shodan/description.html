    {{race}} are the only sentient and reproducing entities to have evolved on {{world}}.
    They can reproduce asexually by a process of fission, but can share 'instructions' 
    or 'schematics' from others of their race. One of the major features of this 
    reproductive style is that both of the 'child' twins have most of the same memories.
    On rare and tragic occasions, these memories can be severely lost, and even the bodies
    can fail completely. When this becomes common knowledge amongst their immediate friends 
    and family, the period of 'birth mourning' begins, which is completed when the full 
    inventory of all the late {{race}}'s memories are catalogued.
