    Having studied their ancient languages, the term 'Homo Cidalis' has been coined 
    to describe their behaviour. They threaten each other with death on an almost 
    daily basis. Their existence is highly unorthodox among alien species, others
    preferring to co-operate.

    In a way, it works for them. They compete with each other, and their people adopt 
    the methods of the most successful competitor. This is the theory. In practise, 
    there is always one attempting to exploit their evolutionary system to simulate 
    the rank of most successful competitor without producing anything of value. This
    is called 'crime' and our race has had individuals guilty of it in the past as
    well, but not to this remarkably unprecedented level.
