    In a previous account, I have been quoted describing humans as "amazing".
    While not entirely incorrect, this has been oversimplified by a probable 
    mis-translation, as the complete quote was "It is amazing they got into space".

    Unlike the other young races, they are no longer using their original biology,
    having upgraded to a superior version instead. Since they are squeamish about
    replacing their bodies with machines, this might serve to delay their extinction
    which would make them the champion species for their biology, since few biologies 
    survive beyond the first 10 billion years. Their reproduction process works 
    against their evolution, favouring irrelevant traits over useful ones. This 
    behaviour would have killed off most species by now.

    Apparently they got as far as they have by being skilled psychopathic murderers.
    Nothing lived long enough to kill them, and once they turned their attention to 
    the stars, they became good at mercilessly vapourising bigger rocks. It doesn't
    appear that they understood what they were doing.

    Their identity is very important to them, which is probably why they see each 
    other as the enemy, and can very easily turn their hostility on another species
    without any provocation. The popular nickname among the Delarion and our sibling 
    nodes is Quadrupedal Free-fires, a term which appears to lack the appropriate 
    urgency in Terran.
