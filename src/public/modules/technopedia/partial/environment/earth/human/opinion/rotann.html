    The Murder-Monkeys? How did they even get into space? The Delarion say 
    "you are young", which usually means they don't know. Our first encounter
    with these war-mongers involved one of their battleships fully powering
    its primitive weapons and training them on us.

    Their existence is thoroughly disturbing. How does a race so bent on 
    being able to destroy anything it encounters survive as long as they have?
    If they had grown up on {{opinion.world}} they would probably have wiped
    us out, and then themselves.

    Even their methods of communication are savage, requiring them to blast 
    each other with kinetic energy.

    Fascinating as they are, they give me nightspasms.
